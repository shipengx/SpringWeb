		<h1>paragraph 1</h1>
		<p>A paragraph is a series of sentences that are organized and
			coherent, and are all related to a single topic. Almost every piece
			of writing you do that is longer than a few sentences should be
			organized into paragraphs. This is because paragraphs show a reader
			where the subdivisions of an essay begin and end, and thus help the
			reader see the organization of the essay and grasp its main points.</p>
		<p>Sunset is the time of day when our sky meets the outer space
			solar winds. There are blue, pink, and purple swirls, spinning and
			twisting, like clouds of balloons caught in a blender. The sun moves
			slowly to hide behind the line of horizon, while the moon races to
			take its place in prominence atop the night sky. People slow to a
			crawl, entranced, fully forgetting the deeds that still must be done.
			There is a coolness, a calmness, when the sun does set.</p>
